# Swiggy_Dashboard_Analysis

# Steps to create dashboard
        * Extracted data from Swiggy_Delivery_dataset from Kaggle(Raw Data)
        * Cleaned the data and through Data Manipulation created some columns
                  Such as:  
                        1. Created a column named Unique_items (Which was Sold and count those items also)
                        2. Created a column named Day_of_week (It will help to get more sales on this day)
                                Like Day 1 - Sunday
                                     Day 2 - Monday
                                     Day 3 - Tuesday
                                     ..
                                     ..
                                     Day 6 - Friday
                                     Day 7 - Saturday
                        3. Created Drop down function which shows city (Where I can get Total Revenue Generated)
        
        * Created Pivot tables Such as:
                        1. REvenue vs Time
                        2. Day_of_week vs Revenue (Where Day 3 and Day 4 are not showing in the table cause having no data)
        * In the Day_of_week vs Price Pivot table. I observed, Sunday has maximum sale and Saturdau has least sale(Day 7).
        * Now We have to increase Sales in Satuday (Need to provide Sales Discounts or coupouns)
                        3. City_vise_Revenue &
                        4. Final Dashboard
                        
# Highest Revenue generated in Indore- INR 96750 (21%)
# Least Revenue generated in Kochi - INR 0 (0%)
